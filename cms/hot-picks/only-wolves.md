The Only Wolves are known for being innovators in the creation of WEB3 & NFT products. The primary goal of our company is to create solutions that music lovers and composers can use every day to buy and sell their creations.

1.The first stage of our journey will culminate in the launch of the Only Wolves DAO program (rewards and voting system), the Only Wolves NFT collection (free to all holders), and raffles!

2\. The second stage of our journey will see the release of a brand new Music NFT collection, the launch of the Only Music NFT Pass for music creators (FREE FOR ONLY WOLVES NFT HOLDERS), and the beginning of the development of Launchpad and a marketplace. Every music creator will be able to instantly upload their songs, covers, and albums to the blockchain, create their own albums, and sell them on our NFT Music marketplace. üé∂üíø
