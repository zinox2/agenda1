Dormint is an AI-powered Web3 sleep analysis app that uses the best practices of GameFi to motivate users to maintain a sleeping schedule by rewarding them with tokens and gamifying an essential biological need.

Retaining a healthy sleep cycle is a growing concern nowadays. The main idea behind Dormint is to not only financially motivate people to form healthy sleeping habits but also help them by introducing free off-chain features according to the latest Somnology findings.
